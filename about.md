I am a limited-term Assistant professor in the [Department of Physics](https://web.unica.it/unica/en/dip_fisica.page) at the [University of Cagliari](https://en.unica.it/en) and a member of the [Konus-Wind team](http://www.ioffe.ru/LEA/index.html) at [Ioffe institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ioffe_Institute).
I work in the area of time-domain astronomy to investigate the most extreme astrophysical transients, from Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) to Soft gamma-repeaters and Solar flares. I am particularly excited by doing population studies of GRBs.

I completed my PhD studies in the Laboratory for Experimental Astrophysics at Ioffe Institute (Saint Petersburg, Russia) working with the [Konus-Wind](https://www.ioffe.ru/LEA/kw/index.html) (KW) team.
As a PhD student, I mostly focused on the studies of GRBs with known redshifts detected in the triggered mode of the KW experiment.
During my postdoc at Ioffe, I carried out a joint KW + Swift/BAT (BAT) spectral analysis of GRBs with known redshifts.
My work in the High-Energy Astrophysics Group at the [Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics](https://www.mpe.mpg.de/main) was focused on cross-calibration of KW, Fermi/GBM, and BAT data.
In the High-Energy Astrophysics Group at the [University of Cagliari](https://en.unica.it/en), I continue the GRB population studies focused on their rest-frame classification, broadband spectral analysis using the data of X-ray telescopes, and comprehensive properties of their light curves. I also got a chance to dive into a magical world of Quantum gravity and its applications to GRBs.
